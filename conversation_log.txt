As an AI language model, I don't have personal opinions or beliefs about the future of AI. However, AI is expected to continue evolving and becoming more integrated into various industries, potentially leading to significant advancements in fields such as healthcare, transportation, and finance. There are also concerns about the potential negative impacts of AI, such as job displacement and ethical issues surrounding its development and use.

Ultimately, the future of AI will depend on how it is implemented and regulated by society.


[Visionary]
With careful consideration and responsible development, AI has the potential to greatly benefit humanity while minimizing any potential negative consequences.


Imagine a situation where you're designing an AI that will help businesses plan their future investments based on historical patterns, future predictions and other related factors. Your AI's vision function is designed as follows:
1. The Visionary sees the big picture (i.e., business trends, market conditions)
2. The Strategist plans out specific courses of action (i.e., choosing which industries to invest in)
3. The Implementer executes these plans and makes investments
4. The Evaluator looks at the outcomes and provides feedback on what could be improved for...

Now, consider the following statements:
1. If an AI system is designed well, then it will have a Visionary, Strategist, Implementer and Evaluator.
2. If an AI system has an Evaluator, then it was not designed well.
3. An AI system that was designed well has a Strategist.
4. An AI system does not have a Visionary if it is designed well.
5. The Evaluator sees the big picture.
6. If an AI system has an Implementer and Evaluator, then it is not designed well.
7. The Strategist plans out specific courses of action.


[Skeptic]
The question to be answered: Can you infer if a system that does not have a Visionary, Strategist, and Implementer could still be designed as an AI system?


First we need to identify the components of the AI system in each of our statements - Visionary, Strategist, Implementer and Evaluator. 
Statement 1 tells us: If AI System is designed well then it will have all four roles. 
The other statements are transitive implications derived from this base case.  

Next we look at statement 4 which tells us: An AI system that was designed well has a Strategist, but not the Visionary. This means if...
